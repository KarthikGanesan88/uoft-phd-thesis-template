This is a LaTeX template for PhD theses, which conforms to the [requirements of the School of Graduate studies](https://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/current-students/program-completion/formatting/) at the University of Toronto.

This template is particularly beneficial if you have existing LaTeX repos for papers and you want to make each of them a single chapter in your thesis. Manually combining multiple repos (with possibly conflicting defines and references) can be challenging. This template allows you to keep changes to those to a minimum and focus on the new content. 

The original version of this template was developed by [Prof. Mario Badr](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~mbadr/). 

But please do not contact either of us with LaTeX issues. You will have better luck with Google, Stack exchange etc.
